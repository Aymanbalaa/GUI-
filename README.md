<h1> GUI DEVELOP START <h1>
<h4> Slowly learning and using Tkinter for GUI development <h4>

<p1> Making login labels disappear and other labels appear --> complex , 
the idea was worked on and then files were completely scraped.
the new plan is to try and do it in multiple windows , one for username one for password,
then well see if it looks clean or not <p1>

<h5> 12/3/23 (dawn) <h5>
<p1> Started the previously mentionned new window for password
there is a new function checkLogin that is not working properly
debugging shows the variable are being wiped before being checked
might have to store them in another var <p1>


<h5> 12/3/23 (noon) <h5>
<p1> some minor changes yet password issue persists , maybe scope related? <p1>
